📌 What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning library developed by Meta (Facebook AI).
It is widely used for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI research & production.

It combines:

🐍 Python’s simplicity

⚡ Torch’s fast tensor computation (GPU supported)

So, PyTorch is easy to write and very fast to run.
